The LiquidCore Project
----------------------

LiquidCore enables Node.js virtual machines to run inside Android and iOS apps.  It provides a complete runtime environment, including a virtual file system and native MySQL support.

LiquidCore also provides a convenient way for Android developers to [execute raw JavaScript](https://github.com/LiquidPlayer/LiquidCore/wiki/LiquidCore-as-a-Native-Javascript-Engine) inside of their apps, as iOS developers can already do natively with JavaScriptCore.

For a description of how to use LiquidCore, please see the appropriate README under [LiquidCoreAndroid](https://github.com/LiquidPlayer/LiquidCore/tree/master/LiquidCoreAndroid) or [LiquidCoreiOS](https://github.com/LiquidPlayer/LiquidCore/tree/master/LiquidCoreiOS).
