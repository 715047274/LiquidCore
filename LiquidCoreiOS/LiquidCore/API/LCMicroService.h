 @discussion Listens for when the MicroService has been inititialized and the environment is ready
 to receive event listeners.  This is called after the Node.js environment has been set
 up, but before the micro service JavaScript code has been executed.  It is safe to add any event
 listeners here, but emitted events will not be seen by the JavaScript service until its code
 has been run.  The JavaScript code should emit an event to let the host know that it is ready
 to receive events.
 @param service The micro service which has now started.
 @param synchronizer Used to synchronize asynchronous init.  Ignore if you have no
 async initialization.  Can be nil if the process cannot be managed asynchronously, so check first.

 available and is shutting down.

 Called immediately before the LCMicroService exits.  This is a graceful exit, and is
 mutually exclusive with the 'onError' method.  Only one of either the exit listener
 or error listener will be called from any LCMicroService.

 LCMicroService is no longer available and may have already crashed.
 
 Called upon an exception state.  This is an unexpected exit, and is mutually exclusive with the
 'onExit' method.  Only one of either the exit listener or error listener will be called from

 @discussion Clients of an LCMicroService communicate with the JavaScript service through an
 event emitter interface.  To listen for specific events, call
 <code>LCMicroService.addEventListener:listener:</code>.  The delegates will be called through
 this protocol.
 
 In JavaScript, Node.js services trigger events by calling <code>LiquidCore.emit(event, payload)</code>.
 The <code>payload</code> can be any JavaScript object and will get converted to the appropriate object
 in the host language (Swift/Objective-C).
