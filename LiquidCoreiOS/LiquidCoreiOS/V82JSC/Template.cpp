/**
 * Whenever the property with the given name is accessed on objects
 * created from this Template the getter and setter callbacks
 * are called instead of getting and setting the property directly
 * on the JavaScript object.
 *
 * \param name The name of the property for which an accessor is added.
 * \param getter The callback to invoke when getting the property.
 * \param setter The callback to invoke when setting the property.
 * \param data A piece of data that will be passed to the getter and setter
 *   callbacks whenever they are invoked.
 * \param settings Access control settings for the accessor. This is a bit
 *   field consisting of one of more of
 *   DEFAULT = 0, ALL_CAN_READ = 1, or ALL_CAN_WRITE = 2.
 *   The default is to not allow cross-context access.
 *   ALL_CAN_READ means that all cross-context reads are allowed.
 *   ALL_CAN_WRITE means that all cross-context writes are allowed.
 *   The combination ALL_CAN_READ | ALL_CAN_WRITE can be used to allow all
 *   cross-context access.
 * \param attribute The attributes of the property for which an accessor
 *   is added.
 * \param signature The signature describes valid receivers for the accessor
 *   and is used to perform implicit instance checks against them. If the
 *   receiver is incompatible (i.e. is not an instance of the constructor as
 *   defined by FunctionTemplate::HasInstance()), an implicit TypeError is
 *   thrown and no callback is invoked.
